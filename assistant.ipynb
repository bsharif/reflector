      "### Review\n",
      "During an emergency craniotomy for a patient diagnosed with severe aortic stenosis, I encountered several significant challenges that required careful planning and execution of anaesthetic management. The patient's high NELA score indicated a substantial risk for perioperative complications. Thus, maintaining cardiovascular stability was paramount. Additionally, we opted for epidural analgesia to enhance postoperative pain management and facilitate recovery in the ICU setting.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Experience Gained\n",
      "This case highlighted the complexities associated with delivering anaesthetic care to high-risk patients. I gained valuable insights into the importance of comprehensive preoperative assessment and the need for a tailored approach to anaesthesia that accounts for the patient's cardiac condition. Collaborating effectively with the surgical team and ICU staff ensured that we were prepared to address potential complications swiftly. I learned to refine my skills in monitoring cardiovascular stability during anaesthesia, especially in patients with significant co-morbidities.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Resulting Change\n",
      "Following this experience, I recognised the necessity of enhancing my understanding of the implications of aortic stenosis on perioperative care. I intend to engage in further learning related to cardiovascular anaesthesia and the application of regional anaesthesia techniques in managing postoperative pain. Additionally, I will advocate for more immediate post-operative follow-ups to ensure early identification of cardiovascular complications.\n",
